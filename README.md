# Dwarf-Fortress-like
This game world is made in C, but uses some object-oriented style coding.
Two neat things it has are Odor and Sound simulations, with analogue-type data being sent to the actors in the environment. 
This was designed as a simple world to test a general AI software my brother and I are working on, but it's not programmable yet.
